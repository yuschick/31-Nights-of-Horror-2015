It's no secret that I have an incredible love for horror movies. The **31 Nights of Horror** series began in 2015 as a way to work on a fun design and coding project while creating a resource for others who are unsure where to turn for good holiday horror.

### 2015 Summary - [View Online](http://yuschick.github.io/31-Nights-of-Horror-2015/)
The 2015 calendar served primarily as a *Best Of* in horror. And of course by 'best' I mean, my personal favorites. This year included only a few lesser known recommendations with little regard toward streaming access or language. At the time, I didn't know this project would become an annual series but at this point has become my favorite project every year.

31 nights, 35 movies spanning different eras and genres. Themed double-feature Sundays, Slasher Saturdays, Throwback Thursdays, and more - are you up for the horror challenge?
